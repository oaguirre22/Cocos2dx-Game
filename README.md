# Vikingo vs Animales Místicos

**Vikingo vs Animales Místicos** is a 2D action-adventure game developed in C++ using the Cocos2D-x engine. Set in a world inspired by Norse mythology, the player takes control of a Viking king on a quest to rescue his son, kidnapped by a witch after a broken pact. The game challenges players through multiple magical realms filled with mythical creatures, hidden allies, and dangerous obstacles.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a final assignment for an advanced programming course, combining core programming skills with game development techniques. The game emphasizes exploration, progression, and dynamic combat mechanics, supported by visually engaging 2D graphics and interactive gameplay.

## Objectives

- **Combine exploration and combat**: Traverse magical realms and fight mythological creatures in progressively challenging levels.
- **Develop smooth 2D graphics and character animations**: Use vibrant, Norse-themed visuals and fluid animations for all characters and environments.
- **Implement progression and difficulty scaling**: Increase challenge through level-based enemy scaling and item-based upgrades.
- **Motivate players through upgrades**: Allow players to collect coins and items to improve the Viking king’s equipment, strength, and resistance.

## Functional Scope

### Core Gameplay

- **Basic controls**: Move left/right and jump using directional input.
- **Levels**: Five distinct levels featuring unique settings, traps, and enemy types.
- **Enemies**: Predefined movement patterns and attacks based on level.
- **Collectibles**: Coins and special artifacts used to unlock equipment and ability upgrades.

### Graphics and Animations

- **2D animated characters**: Smooth movement, attack, and interaction animations for all characters.
- **Parallax backgrounds**: Layered scrolling backgrounds to enhance immersion without adding graphic complexity.
- **Visual effects**: Simple yet effective visual cues like sparks, attack slashes, and collision feedback.

### Sound and Music

- **Sound effects**: Triggered by actions like jumping, attacking, collecting, or getting hit.
- **Ambient music**: Unique background themes for each level to reflect mood and setting.

### User Interface

- **Start screen**: Options to start a new game, load, adjust settings, or exit.
- **Score display**: Score shown upon level completion.
- **Life system**: The player starts with 3 lives, lost by falling into traps or being defeated.

## Development Platform

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Game Engine**: Cocos2D-x (v4.0)
- **Target Platforms**: Android, iOS, and Windows

## Limitations

- **Single-player only**: No multiplayer or cooperative gameplay supported.
- **No additional game modes**: Modes like survival or time attack are excluded in this version.
- **No downloadable content (DLC)**: No plans for expansions or add-on content post-release.

## Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

- Integrate boss fights with complex behavior trees.
- Add a skill tree for character progression.
- Expand with more levels and diverse biomes.
- Implement a save/load system with persistent upgrades.
